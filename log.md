# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing React + Redux course. Was refactoring complex HOCs using compose function. Have learned about partially applied functions and reduceRight().

**Thoughts:** Looking at '300 hours' sign by JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification at freecodecapm and feeling inspired. Will start tomorrow (27/04).
